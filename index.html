    <h2>Today's News</h2>
    <p><strong>Sharp will begin selling the world's first 8K television.</strong></p>
    <p>The 8K TV standard has a resolution of 7680 x 4320 pixels. That means there are nearly 38 million pixels on the screen.
8K offers four times the resolution of 4K TVs (9 million pixels and a 4096 x 2160 resolution) and 16 times the resolution of a 1080p HDTV (2 million pixels with a 1920 x 1080 resolution).
Though 4K (let alone 8K) is still a rarity, the television industry is pushing hard to increase the standard broadcast resolution from HD to "ultra-HD" in the next few years. But there doesn't appear to be too much momentum behind that push.
To watch an 8K video on Sharp's new LV-85001, you'll have to use all four HDMI connectors and have a computer that supports 8K video output.</p>

    <h2>Samsung</h2>
    <p>has agreed to pay Apple $548m (£362m) as part of a deal to settle a long-running patent dispute.</p>
    <p>
	The arrangement was revealed in papers filed to a California court by both companies on Thursday. The dispute began in 2011 when Apple said Samsung was using some of its patented technologies without permission. The payment does not mean the end of the row as, next year, a US court will decide if Apple deserves more damages.</p>

    <h2>Wearables like Fitbit, Apple Watch are popular holiday buys</h2>
    <p>Wearables haven’t played a big role in holiday sales in the past but that may be changing. Both the Apple Watch and wearables from Fitbit were hot Black Friday items, according to a statement from Target, which listed both among the “most popular items.” And Best Buy said on Sunday that “customers purchased twice as many wearables, including smartwatches and health-and-fitness trackers, as they did a year ago.</p>
    <p>Discounting is important because the Apple Watch isn’t cheap.  It starts at $349 -- the high end of the range for other smart wristwear products like FitBit -- and most of the models are priced over $400. Its big advantage is that it’s packed with functions that less expensive wristwear devices don’t have, such as a data-rich display, the ability to take phone calls, respond to emails and texts, and apps like photo libraries and maps.  That’s in addition to a host of fitness and health tracking features.  And it’s tied to one of the world’s most popular smartphones.
